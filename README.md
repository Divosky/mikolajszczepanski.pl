## Why so much spaghetti?!
```
I had no time, had to do this as fast as I could. It will be rewritten, sorry.
As soon as I get my own PC/macbook and free time, I will rewrite the code and make it mobile-first.
Unfortunately, my life isn't letting me doing so now. Once again - sorry for reading spaghetti.
